## 🚀 Task Mode & Specialized Agents

**Claude Code's Task Mode** allows deploying specialized agents for focused development work. This project successfully used:

### Database Integration Agent
- **Usage**: `Task tool with subagent_type: "general-purpose"`
- **Result**: Complete PostgreSQL + Prisma integration with 15+ models
- **When to use**: Complex multi-step technical implementations

### How to Deploy Specialized Agents:
```
I need help with [complex technical task]. Please use the Task tool to deploy a specialized agent that can:
1. [Specific technical requirement]
2. [Implementation details]
3. [Expected deliverable]
```

### Agent Benefits:
- **Focused Expertise**: Agents specialize in specific domains
- **Complex Problem Solving**: Handle multi-step technical challenges
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain project understanding throughout implementation
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in error handling and validation

## 🗄️ Database Architecture (Production-Ready)

### Complete PostgreSQL Schema:
- **Products**: Multi-platform pricing, categories, warehouse integration
- **Orders**: Customer relationships, platform tracking, status management
- **Customers**: CRM with order history and analytics
- **WarehouseStock**: Real-time inventory tracking
- **Bundles**: Component relationships and availability calculations
- **Suppliers**: Purchase order management
- **Platform Integration**: Multi-channel sync capabilities

### Database Operations:
```bash
# Setup database (development)
npm run db:generate && npm run db:push && npm run db:seed

# Production deployment (Vercel)
# Add DATABASE_URL to environment variables
# Database automatically initializes on first deployment
```

## 📝 Development Best Practices

### Code Quality Standards:
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with generated Prisma types
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/catch with user-friendly messages
- **Performance**: Optimized database queries with proper relationships
- **Security**: No exposed secrets, secure environment variable handling
- **Testing**: Ready for unit and integration tests

### When Continuing Development:
1. **Always read progress file first** for complete context
2. **Use Task mode** for complex features or architectural changes
3. **Run type checking** before committing: `npm run type-check`
4. **Test database operations** in development before production
5. **Follow established patterns** - examine existing code for conventions

### About "2% left until auto compact":
This message typically refers to Git repository optimization. It's automatically handled by Git and doesn't require action. If it appears frequently, running `git gc` can manually trigger garbage collection.
