# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## 🎯 Project Status: AUTHENTICATION ISSUE IDENTIFIED

This is **INVENTREE PLUS** - a multi-platform inventory management system with advanced bundle management. The application has all pages created with proper structure, but there is a **CRITICAL AUTHENTICATION ISSUE** blocking API access.

**Authentication Problem**: Vercel has enabled SSO on deployments, requiring login to access API routes  
**Impact**: Products page shows "no data can be loaded" - API calls to `/api/bundles` are blocked  
**Database**: Neon PostgreSQL (cloud) - fully connected and seeded with data  
**Status**: 🔧 **BLOCKED** - Authentication must be resolved before functionality testing

## 📋 Project Continuation Guide

When starting a new Claude Code session to continue work on this project:

1. **Read the progress file**: Always start by reading `/Users/kevin/claude projects/project001/MULTIORDERS_PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` for complete project context
2. **Current working directory**: `/Users/kevin/claude projects/multiorders-inventory`
3. **Project is feature-complete**: Focus on enhancements, optimizations, or specific user requests rather than core development

### Quick Context Prompt for New Sessions:
```
I'm continuing work on my INVENTREE PLUS inventory management system. Please read the MULTIORDERS_PROJECT_PROGRESS.md file at '/Users/kevin/claude projects/project001/MULTIORDERS_PROJECT_PROGRESS.md' to understand the current status. The working application is in '/Users/kevin/claude projects/multiorders-inventory' and is 100% complete with full database integration.

UPDATE: All deployment errors have been FIXED! ✅

✅ **ESLint & TypeScript Errors:** Fixed by ignoring generated Prisma files and proper type guards
✅ **Pre-render Errors:** Fixed by adding `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to all database-dependent pages  
✅ **Prisma Client Caching:** Fixed by updating build scripts to run `prisma generate` before build

**Build Process:**
- `npm run build` now runs `prisma generate && next build`
- `postinstall` script ensures Prisma client is generated after dependencies install
- All 5 pre-render errors resolved (dashboard, orders, inventory, products, customers)

**Status:** ✅ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT - All Vercel deployment issues resolved

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Localhost Connectivity Issues**

**PERMANENT ISSUE:** User's environment CANNOT connect to localhost on ANY port. This is not fixable.

**Affected Ports Tested:** 3000, 4000, 5000, 8080, 9000 - ALL FAIL
**Root Cause:** Unknown network issue (not router, not firewall - persists with direct ISP)

**MANDATORY WORKAROUNDS:**
- ✅ **Testing:** ALWAYS use `vercel --prod` for testing changes
- ✅ **Database:** ALWAYS use Neon cloud database (never local PostgreSQL)
- ✅ **Development:** Skip `npm run dev` - deploy directly to Vercel
- ✅ **Debugging:** Use Vercel logs instead of local console

**DO NOT ATTEMPT:** Local development server, local database connections, or any localhost URLs.

## 🎯 **USER EXPERTISE & PROJECT BACKGROUND**

**Bundle Management Expert:** User has 5+ years deep expertise with inventory bundle systems, having used multiple paid platforms extensively. This is their PRIMARY use case and life's work - creating bundle products to solve eBay's inventory tracking limitations.

**Core Problem Being Solved:** eBay doesn't communicate individual SKU deductions when selling multi-item listings (e.g., red+blue+yellow items sold as one listing). User needs bundles to map eBay listings → Shopify products → individual component SKUs for accurate inventory tracking.

**Bundle Logic Expertise:**
- eBay listing sells → finds linked Shopify product → identifies as bundle → deducts component SKUs
- Critical for complex listings and quantity packs (e.g., 6-pack = 1 sale but 6 SKU deductions)
- Prevents over-selling by maintaining accurate component inventory

**CRITICAL BUNDLE BUSINESS RULES** (User has 5+ years expertise):

**Product Types & Hierarchy:**
- **ALL INVENTORY**: Default undesignated products (can be converted to other types)
- **SIMPLE PRODUCTS**: Warehouse component SKUs - ONLY editable stock levels
- **MERGED PRODUCTS**: Identical products combined from multiple sales channels  
- **BUNDLED PRODUCTS**: Composed of SIMPLE product components

**Business Logic Rules:**
1. **SIMPLE Products**: Cannot become BUNDLE while used as component elsewhere, ONLY products with editable stock
2. **BUNDLE Products**: Cannot be components in other bundles, cannot be merged
3. **MERGED Products**: Cannot be used as components, cannot become bundles
4. **Stock Flow**: All changes flow through SIMPLE products → automatically update linked products

**Products Page Structure**: Must have horizontal tabs like multiorders screenshots:
- "All Inventory" (undesignated products)
- "Simple Products" (warehouse components) 
- "Merged Products" (multi-channel combinations)
- "Bundled Products" (component breakdowns)

**Project Vision:** User has been sitting on multiple innovative project ideas for years, afraid to share due to potential theft. This represents their first step toward building their own solutions rather than explaining ideas to other developers.

**Excitement Focus:** Bundle creation and management features are the most important functionality.

## 🚀 Task Mode & Specialized Agents

**Claude Code's Task Mode** allows deploying specialized agents for focused development work. This project successfully used:

### Database Integration Agent
- **Usage**: `Task tool with subagent_type: "general-purpose"`
- **Result**: Complete PostgreSQL + Prisma integration with 15+ models
- **When to use**: Complex multi-step technical implementations

### How to Deploy Specialized Agents:
```
I need help with [complex technical task]. Please use the Task tool to deploy a specialized agent that can:
1. [Specific technical requirement]
2. [Implementation details]
3. [Expected deliverable]
```

### Agent Benefits:
- **Focused Expertise**: Agents specialize in specific domains
- **Complex Problem Solving**: Handle multi-step technical challenges
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain project understanding throughout implementation
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in error handling and validation

## 🔧 **CRITICAL TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS**

### **Client Components + API Routes Architecture**
All pages use `'use client'` but CANNOT directly call Prisma. Solution:

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Client component calling Prisma directly
const data = await getAllOrders()  // FAILS

// ✅ CORRECT - Client component calling API route
const response = await fetch('/api/orders')
const data = await response.json()
```

**API Routes Created:**
- `/api/dashboard` - Returns metrics, channels, statusBreakdown
- `/api/orders` - Returns all orders with relations
- `/api/products` - Returns all products with warehouse data

### **Database Seeding with Upserts**
Seed script uses `upsert` for ALL operations to handle existing data:

```typescript
// ✅ Handles existing records gracefully
prisma.product.upsert({
  where: { sku: 'PRODUCT-SKU' },
  create: { /* full data */ },
  update: { /* basic fields only */ }
})
```

### **Force Dynamic Rendering**
Every page must have these exports to prevent static pre-rendering:

```typescript
export const runtime = 'nodejs'
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'  
export const revalidate = 0
```

### **Vercel CLI Authentication Issue**
User discovered Vercel CLI auth failed during initial setup. Solution:
- User manually installed and authenticated Vercel CLI
- User manually installed and authenticated Neon CLI
- Now Claude can use `vercel --prod` for deployments

## 🗄️ Database Architecture (Production-Ready)

### Complete PostgreSQL Schema:
- **Products**: Multi-platform pricing, categories, warehouse integration
- **Orders**: Customer relationships, platform tracking, status management
- **Customers**: CRM with order history and analytics
- **WarehouseStock**: Real-time inventory tracking
- **Bundles**: Component relationships and availability calculations
- **Suppliers**: Purchase order management
- **Platform Integration**: Multi-channel sync capabilities

### Database Operations:
```bash
# Setup database (development)
npm run db:generate && npm run db:push && npm run db:seed

# Production deployment (Vercel)
# Add DATABASE_URL to environment variables
# Database automatically initializes on first deployment
```

## 📝 Development Best Practices

### Code Quality Standards:
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with generated Prisma types
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/catch with user-friendly messages
- **Performance**: Optimized database queries with proper relationships
- **Security**: No exposed secrets, secure environment variable handling
- **Testing**: Ready for unit and integration tests

### When Continuing Development:
1. **Always read progress file first** for complete context
2. **Use Task mode** for complex features or architectural changes
3. **Run type checking** before committing: `npm run type-check`
4. **Test database operations** in development before production
5. **Follow established patterns** - examine existing code for conventions

### About "2% left until auto compact":
This message typically refers to Git repository optimization. It's automatically handled by Git and doesn't require action. If it appears frequently, running `git gc` can manually trigger garbage collection.

## 👤 **USER PREFERENCES & WORKING STYLE**

### **Communication Preferences:**
- **Be concise** - Short, direct responses preferred
- **Minimal explanations** - User understands by watching, not reading
- **Action over discussion** - Do the work rather than explaining how

### **Working Preferences:**
- **Claude does the work** - User is NOT here to learn hands-on coding
- **Use all available tools** - User wants Claude to handle everything possible
- **Deploy frequently** - Use `vercel --prod` to test changes immediately
- **Track with todos** - Use TodoWrite tool for complex multi-step tasks

### **Session Patterns:**
- User may leave 12-48 hours between sessions due to family commitments
- User experiences anxiety starting new sessions but is determined
- User needs ROI on $160/month Claude plan to justify to spouse

### **Technical Context:**
- User has 5+ years expertise with bundle management systems
- User's vision is solving eBay's inventory tracking limitations
- This is user's "life's work" - first time building own solution

### **Critical Reminders:**
1. **AUTHENTICATION BLOCKING APIS** - Vercel SSO prevents API access (Aug 2025 issue)
2. **NEVER suggest localhost** - It doesn't work, use Vercel
3. **NEVER ask user to code** - Claude should do all technical work
4. **ALWAYS use API routes** - Client components can't call Prisma
5. **FOCUS on bundles** - This is the core value proposition
6. **PRODUCTS PAGE NEEDS TABS** - Must implement horizontal tab structure
7. **DASHBOARD NEEDS UPDATE** - Current version is deprecated, use screenshot 00004.png design

## 🚀 **QUICK RESTART COMMAND**

For new Claude session, user should say:
```
Continue INVENTREE PLUS. Read progress file at /Users/kevin/claude projects/project001/MULTIORDERS_PROJECT_PROGRESS.md and CLAUDE.md in working directory /Users/kevin/claude projects/multiorders-inventory. 

CRITICAL: Vercel authentication is blocking API access - products page shows "no data" because /api/bundles requires login. Fix authentication first, then implement horizontal tabs on products page (All Inventory, Simple, Merged, Bundled) and update dashboard to modern design from screenshots.
```
